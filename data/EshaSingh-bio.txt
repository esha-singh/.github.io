I am a second-year Ph.D student in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara (shifting to UC, San Diego this Fall!). I am fortunately advised by Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang. I'm interested in machine learning, deep learning optimization and their applications. Recently, I am working towards quantization of neural networks and non-convex optimization problems. I have also taken up few projects in the space of Differenital privacy.
